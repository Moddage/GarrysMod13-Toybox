# Funbox
Funbox is a useful single player only alternative to the workshop, it is based on the old yet similar system Toybox. Funbox supports entities, weapons, props, saves, and maps. It works by downloading a GMA file from online and saving it in data. It can be loaded at anytime in the future as long as there is no update to the file avaliable.
